# Description:      Program was created to take in the userâ€™s adjusted gross income, prompt them to enter their marital status, and then based on their inputs, calculate their annual taxes for them. 
# Input:            adjustedGrossIncome, status, and taxWithheld as int types 
# Output:           taxable, taxAmt, tempVar as double types
